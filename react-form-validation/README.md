React Form with Custom Validation and Routing

This project is a user registration form built with React  that demonstrates custom form validation without using third-party libraries. It includes:

Required Fields: First Name, Last Name, Username, Email, Password (with show/hide toggle), Phone Number (with country code), Country (dropdown), City (dropdown), PAN Number, and Aadhar Number.
Validation: Inline error messages for each field.
UX Enhancements: Submit button is disabled until all fields are valid.
Routing: Upon successful submission, the app navigates to a new route displaying all entered user details.
